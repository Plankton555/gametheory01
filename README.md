Follower's Game

We consider a game for n ≥ 2 players who compete in a game of m rounds. 
During each round, each player chooses to follow any number of the other players, 
that is, the set of actions for a round is the set of directed graphs with n nodes. 
Player i’s follows are the players that i has chosen, and i’s k-audience is the set of 
players that can reach i in k or fewer steps. Each player would like to maximize his audience and minimize his follows. 
The utility function for a single round is ui=-cfi+kk(ai(k)-ai(k-1)), where c is the cost per follow, 
fi is the number of i’s follows, ai(k)is the number of players in i’s k-audience, and  is a discount factor. 
In the single-round game, the only Nash Equilibrium is that none of the players have any audience.
